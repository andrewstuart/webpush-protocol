# Introduction

The WebPush is a simple notification and small data delievery system designed to
be easy to implement, scalable, and robust.  The WebPush protocol enables
application servers to delivery guarantees, minimal server state, and client
driven recovery. It is a signaling and and data carrying system.

# Definitions

{:br: vspace="0"}

AppServer : The third-party server or application which will generate a Push
Event by accessing the Endpoint

Application : A program which requires access to push notifications. The
UserAgent acts on

Channel : The flow of information from AppServer through WebPushServer to
UserAgent.  ChannelID : Unique identifier for a Channel. Generated by UserAgent
for a particular application. Opaque identifier for both UserAgent and
WebPushServer. This MUST NOT be exposed to an application.

Endpoint : A REST-ful HTTP URL uniquely associated to a channel. Requests to
this URL should update the WebPushServer state for the channel. MUST be exposed
to third-party applications.

UAID : A globally unique UserAgent ID. Used by the WebPushServer to associate
channelIDs with a client. Stored by the UserAgent, but opaque to it.

UserAgent : A device or program that implements the client side of the WebPush
Protocol.

Version : Monotonically increasing 64-bit integer describing the application
state. This holds meaning as a primary key or similar only to the AppServer. The
WebPushServer and UserAgent and App should use this only for detecting changes.
MUST be exposed to applications.

WebPushServer : A publicly accessible server that implements the server side of
the WebPush Protocol and exposes an HTTP API for AppServer's to notify it.
behalf of applications.

# Protocol Overview

The WebPush protocol defines how UserAgents and WebPushServers communicate to
ensure reliable delivery of the latest version of a channel from the
WebPushServer to the UserAgent.

The WebPush communication channel is WebSockets, and the wire protocol is
JSON, with messages defined below.  The WebSocket specific HTTP header
`Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` MUST be set to `push-notification` by the
UserAgent. The WebPushServer SHOULD reject the connection if the header is not
set.

All messages MUST use TLS (wss:// protocol for WebSockets). In addition,
Endpoints generated by WebPushServer's MUST use HTTPS URLs.

# Messages

All messages are encoded as JSON. All messages MUST have the following fields:

messageType (string)
: Defines the message type
{: br}

## Handshake

After the WebSocket is established, including whatever optional WebPushServer
authentication is required, the UserAgent begins communication by sending a
`hello` message.  The hello message contains the UAID of the UserAgent has one
or returned by the server from an earlier handshake. The UserAgent may also
transmit the channelIDs it knows so the server may synchronize its state.

The server MAY respect this UAID, but it is at liberty to ask the UserAgent to
change its UAID in the response.

If the UserAgent receives a new UAID in the `hello` response, it MUST delete all
existing channelIDs and their associated versions. It MAY then wake up all
registered applications immediately or at a later date by sending them a
`push-register` message.

The handshake is considered ''complete'', once the UserAgent has received a
reply.

An UserAgent MUST transmit a `hello` message *only once* on its WebSocket.  If
the handshake is not completed in the first try, it MUST disconnect the
WebSocket and begin a new connection.

*NOTE:* Applications may request registrations or unregistrations from the
UserAgent, before or when the handshake is in progress. The UserAgent MAY buffer
these or report errors to the application. But it MUST NOT send these requests
to the WebPushServer until the handshake is completed.

### UserAgent -> WebPushServer

messageType = "hello"

: Begin handshake

uaid string (REQUIRED)

: If the UserAgent has a previously assigned UAID, it should send it. Otherwise
send an empty string.

channelIDs list of strings (OPTIONAL)

: If the UserAgent has a list of channelIDs it wants to be notified of, it may
pass these, otherwise an empty list.

{: br}

Extra fields:
The UserAgent MAY pass any extra JSON data to the WebPushServer. For example,
this data may include information required to wake up the UserAgent using
out-of-band, proprietary methods, or contain the last time the UserAgent
successfully connected. Fields prefixed by "wp-" are reserved for future WebPush
use. The WebPushServer MAY ignore this data.

#### Example

~~~~~
  {
    "messageType": "hello",
    "uaid": "fd52438f-1c49-41e0-a2e4-98e49833cc9c",
    "channelIDs": ["431b4391-c78f-429a-a134-f890b5adc0bb",
                   "a7695fa0-9623-4890-9c08-cce0231e4b36"],
    "lastAccess": 1399049780
  }
~~~~~

### WebPushServer -> UserAgent

WebPushServers MUST only respond to a hello once.
UserAgents MUST ignore multiple hello replies.

messageType = "hello"
: Responses generally have the same messageType as the request

uaid string (REQUIRED)
: If the UserAgent provides an empty or invalid UAID value, the WebPushServer
will generate and return a new UAID value. If the UserAgent sent a valid UAID
and the WebPushServer is now in sync with the UserAgent, return the UserAgent
provided UAID. It is RECOMMENDED that a UAID be a UUIDv4 token.

status number (REQUIRED)
: A HTTP compatible numeric code indicating the status of the request. For
example; A 200 request indicates normal success, a 302 indicates a redirect
request, a 500 indicates a server error has occurred, etc.)

redirect string (OPTIONAL)

: The WebPushServer may optionally request that the UserAgent reconnect to a
different URL.  The UserAgent MUST disconnect on receiving this command and try
reconnecting to the associated URL.

Extra fields:
The WebPushServer MAY pass any extra JSON data back to the UserAgent. Fields
prefixed by "wp-" are reserved for future WebPush use. The UserAgent MAY ignore
this data.


[todo] what kind of restrictions do we want to put on the redirect

{: br}


#### Example

~~~~~
  {
    "messageType": "hello",
    "status": 200,
    "uaid": "fd52438f-1c49-41e0-a2e4-98e49833cc9c",
    "connected": 1399049780
  }
~~~~~

## Register

The Register message is used by the UserAgent to request that the WebPushServer
notify it when a channel changes. Since channelIDs are associated with only one
UAID, this effectively creates the channel, while unregister destroys the
channel.

The channelID is chosen by the UserAgent because it also acts like a nonce for
the Register message itself. Because of this WebPushServers MAY respond out of
order to multiple register messages or messages may be lost without compromising
correctness of the protocol.

The request is considered successful only after a response is received with a
status code of 200.

On success the UserAgent MUST:

* Update its persistent storage based on the response
* Notify the application of a successful registration.
* On error, the UserAgent MUST notify the application as soon as possible.

NOTE: The register call is made by the UserAgent on behalf of an
application. The UserAgent SHOULD have reasonable timeouts in place so that the
application is not kept waiting for too long if the server does not respond or
the UserAgent has to retry the connection.

### UserAgent -> WebPushServer

;messageType = "register"

;channelID string (REQUIRED)
:A unique identifier generated by the UserAgent, distinct from any existing
channelIDs it has registered. It is RECOMMENDED that this is a UUIDv4 token.

#### Example

~~~~
  {
    "messageType": "register",
    "channelID": "d9b74644-4f97-46aa-b8fa-9393985cd6cd"
  }
~~~~

### WebPushServer -> UserAgent

messageType = "register"

channelID string (REQUIRED)
: This MUST be the same as the channelID sent by the
UserAgent in the register request that this message is a response to.

status number (REQUIRED)
: An HTTP compatible numeric value indicating the status of the request. used to
indicate success/failure.  MUST be one of:
* 200 - OK. Success. Idempotent: If the WebPushServer receives a register for
  the same channelID from a UserAgent which already has a registration for the
channelID, it should still respond with success.
* 409 - Conflict. The chosen ChannelID is already in use and NOT associated with
  this UserAgent. UserAgent SHOULD retry with a new ChannelID as soon as
possible.
* 500 - Internal server error. Database out of space or offline. Disk space full
  or whatever other reason due to which the WebPushServer could not grant this
registration. UserAgent SHOULD avoid retrying immediately.
pushEndpoint string (REQUIRED)
: Should be the URL sent to the application by the UserAgent. AppServers will
contact the WebPushServer at this URL to update the version of the channel
identified by channelID.

{: br}

#### Example

~~~~
  {
    "messageType": "register",
    "channelID": "d9b74644-4f97-46aa-b8fa-9393985cd6cd",
    "status": 200,
    "pushEndpoint": "http://pushserver.example.org/d9b74644"
  }
~~~~

## Unregister

Unregistration is an optional procedure.

The unregister is required only between the App and the UserAgent, so that the
UserAgent stops notifying the App when the App is no longer interested in a
pushEndpoint.

The unregister is also useful to the AppServer, because it should stop sending
notifications to an endpoint the App is no longer monitoring. Even then, it is
really an optimization so that the AppServer need not have some sort of garbage
collection mechanism to clean up endpoints at intervals of time.

Well behaved AppServers will stop notifying it of unregistered endpoints
automatically. Well behaved UserAgents won't notify their apps of unregistered
updates either. So the WebPushServer can continue to process notifications and
pass them on to UserAgents, when it has not been told about the unregistration.

When an App calls `unregister(endpoint)` it is RECOMMENDED that the UserAgent
follow these steps:

* Remove its local registration first, for example from the database.
  This will allow it to immediately start ignoring updates.
* Notify the App that unregistration succeeded.
* Fire off an unregister message to the WebPushServer

### UserAgent -> WebPushServer

messageType = "unregister"

channelID string (REQUIRED)
: The previously registered ChannelID the UserAgent no longer wishes to receive
updates for.

{: br}

#### Example

~~~~
  {
    "messageType": "unregister",
    "channelID": "d9b74644-4f97-46aa-b8fa-9393985cd6cd"
  }
~~~~

### WebPushServer -> UserAgent

messageType = "unregister"

channelID string (REQUIRED)
: This MUST be the same as the channelID sent by the UserAgent in the unregister
request that this message is a response to.

status number (REQUIRED)
: Used to indicate success/failure. MUST be one of:
  * 200 - OK. Success. Idempotent: If the WebPushServer receives a unregister
  * 500 - Internal server error. Database offline or whatever other reason due
    to which the WebPushServer could not grant this unregistration. UserAgent
SHOULD avoid retrying immediately.

{: br}

#### Example

~~~~
  {
    "messageType": "unregister",
    "channelID": "d9b74644-4f97-46aa-b8fa-9393985cd6cd",
    "status": 200
  }
~~~~

## Ping

The connection to the WebPush Server may be lost due to network issues. When the
UserAgent detects loss of network, it should reconnect. There are situations in
which the TCP connection dies without either end discovering it immediately. The
UserAgent should send a ping approximately every 30 minutes and expect a reply
from the server in a reasonable time (The Mozilla UserAgent uses 10 seconds). If
no data is received, the connection should be presumed closed and a new
connection started.

The UserAgent should consider normal communications as an indication that the
socket is working properly. It SHOULD send the ping packet only if no activity
has occurred in the past 30 minutes.

#### UserAgent -> WebPushServer

An empty JSON object (The 2-character string `{}`) is sent. This object requires
no alternative processing on the server, keeping transmission size small.

### WebPushServer -> UserAgent

The WebPushServer may reply with any data. The UserAgent is only concerned about
the state of the connection. It is RECOMMENDED that the WebPushServer either
deliver pending notifications or an empty JSON object (`{}`).

## Notification

### AppServer -> WebPushServer

[todo] add data to this.

The AppServer MUST make a HTTP *PUT* request to the Endpoint received from the
App.

If no request body is present, the server MAY presume the version to be the
current server UTC.

If the request body is present, the Content-Type MUST be
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and the request body MUST contain the string
"version=N".

Authentication is optional and left to the WebPushServer provider.

#### Example

~~~~~

 curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d
"version=123" "https://push.example.com/endpoint/123abcd"

~~~~~

### WebPushServer -> AppServer

The HTTP response status code indicates if the request was successful.

* 200 - OK. The WebPushServer will attempt to deliver a notification to the
  associated UserAgent.
* 500 - Something went wrong with the server. Rare, but the AppServer should try
  again.
* 503 - Back off. Server is receiving too many requests per second. Please use
  an exponential back off policy.

Additional status codes may be returned based on requirements of the
WebPushServer provider. Please refer to the provider documentation.

The HTTP response body SHOULD be empty.

### WebPushServer -> UserAgent

Notifications are *acknowledged* by the UserAgent.  WebPushServers should retry
unacknowledged notifications every 60 seconds.  If the version of an
unacknowledged notification is updated, the WebPushServer MAY queue up a new
notification for this channelID and the new version, and remove the old
notification from the pending queue.

The Notification message may contain additional data specific to the
WebPushServer provider. This data may be safely ignored by the UserAgent. Please
refer to the WebPushServer provider documentation for details regarding this
data. Please note that fields prefixed by "wp-" are considered reserved for
future use by WebPush.

messageType: "notification"

updates list  REQUIRED
: The list contains one or more {"channelID": "id", "version": N } pairs.

{: br}

##### Example

~~~~
  {
    "messageType": "notification",
    "updates": [
      { "channelID": "431b4391-c78f-429a-a134-f890b5adc0bb",
        "version": 23,
        "data": "" },
      { "channelID": "a7695fa0-9623-4890-9c08-cce0231e4b36",
        "version": 42,
        "data": "Make the Internet work better" } ]
  }
~~~~

#### UserAgent -> WebPushServer

It is RECOMMENDED that the UserAgent try to batch all pending
acknowledgments into fewer messages. ACK messages do not require a
response from the WebPushServer.

messageType ="ack"

updates list
: The list contains one or more {"channelID": channelID, "version": N} pairs.

{: br}

[TODO]
 -- ack does not require DATA response!

##### Example

~~~~
  {
    "messageType": "ack",
    "updates": [
       { "channelID": "431b4391-c78f-429a-a134-f890b5adc0bb",
         "version": 23 },
       { "channelID": "a7695fa0-9623-4890-9c08-cce0231e4b36",
         "version": 42 } ]
  }
~~~~

# Synchronization of server and client state

# Achieving reliable delivery

At any time, if the WebPushServer reaches an inconsistent condition, due to
database failure, network failure, or any other reason, it MAY drop all
state. It MUST then disconnect all active clients, forcing them to reconnect and
begin a handshake to get synchronized.

# WebPushServer Data Retention Policy

The Data Retention policy of the WebPushServer is determined by the provider of
the service. It is RECOMMENDED that when data for a given UAID is expired
without access, the UAID is marked as invalid, resulting in the UserAgent
re-registering channels.

# Alternative communication

In environments or devices where maintaining an always alive WebSocket is
difficult, UserAgents and WebPushServers MAY implement alternative means to
notify UserAgents about updates. This out of band notification SHOULD be
restricted to request the UserAgent to establish the WebSocket. WebPush state
SHOULD NOT be transmitted out of band, since reliable delivery may not be
guaranteed.
